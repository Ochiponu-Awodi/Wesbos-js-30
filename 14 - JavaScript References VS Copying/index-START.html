    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // team[3] = 'Lux';


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // console.log(players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();

    team2[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Whatever';

    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Again';
    
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99;

    // console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });

    console.log(person, captain);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const cap2 = {...person};

    console.log(cap2);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    dev.name = 'wesley';
    console.log(dev);
    // dev.social.facebook = 'Changed' //One level deep, It will change that property for both objects.

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.facebook = 'changed'; /* It's first turned into a string with json.stringify then turned back into an object with json.parse, making a copy. It's often reffered to as the poor man deep clone though */
